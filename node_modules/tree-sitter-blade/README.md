# Tree-Sitter-Blade üå≥

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please keep an eye on the _release-notes_ until v1.0.0 is out.‚ö†Ô∏è

-   The grammar is stable, but still being polished, as a result there
    might be some breaking changes. These could simply be due to
    unforeseen **rule name** changes, that might in return affect your
    `injection.scm` or `highlights.scm`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è v0.9.0 Upgrade Guide ‚ú®

-   There had been some structural refactor to make the grammar future
    proof, semantic and flexible as it grows with Laravel
-   Please read the `v0.9.0`
    [Release Note for the Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/releases/tag/v0.9.0),
    if you have any questions, feel free to start a discussion or
    raise an issue
-   As soon as you change your `injections.scm` you're good to go ‚úÖ
    to enjoy all the new features ‚ú®
-   I have also updated the instructions underneath üëá for the new and
    upcoming users

## Introduction (feel free to skip)

This project aims to write the tree-sitter grammar for
[Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#main-content).

The grammar could potentially be used in any editors or services that are
based on [Tree-Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).
Such as, but not limited to:

-   **_Neovim_**
-   **_Zed_**
-   **_Nova_**
-   **_Github_**
-   **_Emacs_**

## Sponsorship ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you found this project helpful, I would really appreciate if you
can [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/EmranMR) me so that I could
keep maintaining and improving the grammar to include the entire
**Laravel Ecosystem** inlcluding **Livewire**, **AlpineJS**,
**Inertia** and so forth. Furthermore keeping the project up to date
with **future releases of Laravel**.

Simply install the
[Laravel Suite Extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/emran-mr/emran-mr.laravel/)
from the Extension Library. That includes:

1. injections including the `php injection` out of the box!
2. Autocompletion
3. Folding
4. Syntax Highlighting
5. Auto Indentation

## NeoVim Users

If you are a NeoVim user and would like to give this parser a shot, I
would highly recommend checking out the
[NeoVim Discussion](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/discussions/19#discussion-5400675)

Especially if you encounter any issues!

## Injections:

You could have a look at the `queries/injection.scm` and simply copy
and paste. But here are some detailed information:

### 1. `(php)`

-   This will inject `html/php` into your document

```scm
((text) @injection.content
   (#not-has-ancestor? @injection.content "envoy")
   (#set! injection.combined)
   (#set! injection.language php))
```

### 2. `(php_only)`

-   The `php_only` injections are now finally possible thanks to the
    contribution by @CalebDW on the
    [tree-sitter-php#192](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php/pull/192)
    repo! üöÄ

-   You inject `php_only` into `(php_only)` nodes. This is for all the
    php directives including `{{ x }}`, `{!! x !!}} ` and so forth

```scm
((php_only) @injection.content
   (#set! injection.language php_only))
```

### 3. optional: `(parameter)`

-   This will add a nice syntax highlighting for your parameters
-   This is also a php injection point. I initially had this aliased
    as `(php_only)`, however I decided to keep it separate.
-   This is for all the inline directives such as `@extends(x)`,
    `@yield(x)` and so forth
-   you inject `php_only` in `(parameter)` to get a nice syntax
    highlighting

```scm
((parameter) @injection.content
   (#set! injection.language php_only))
```

### 4. Envoy/Bash

-   This is used specifically for Laravel Envoy
-   Mainly to parse the stuff inside the `@task`
-   You will get a nice `shell` syntax highlighting and possibly
    completion when writing your envoys
-   For your hooks, `@before, @after ... ` you will correctly get a
    `php_only` injections provided by the code above, automatically.
    > You can use whatever you want, zsh etc Here is an an example
    > with `bash`

```scm
((text) @injection.content
   (#has-ancestor? @injection.content "envoy")
   (#set! injection.combined)
   (#set! injection.language bash))
```

### 5. javascript

-   For AlpineJS and `::attributes` you could extend you
    `tree-sitter-html` queries at
    `nvim/after/queries/html/injections.scm` using the following
    snippet provided by @calebDW. see
    [issue#33](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues/33#issuecomment-1871463838)
    if interested.

```scm
;; extends

; AlpineJS attributes
(attribute
  (attribute_name) @_attr
    (#lua-match? @_attr "^x%-%l")
  (quoted_attribute_value
    (attribute_value) @injection.content)
  (#set! injection.language "javascript"))

; Blade escaped JS attributes
; <x-foo ::bar="baz" />
(element
  (_
    (tag_name) @_tag
      (#lua-match? @_tag "^x%-%l")
  (attribute
    (attribute_name) @_attr
      (#lua-match? @_attr "^::%l")
    (quoted_attribute_value
      (attribute_value) @injection.content)
    (#set! injection.language "javascript"))))

; Blade PHP attributes
; <x-foo :bar="$baz" />
(element
  (_
    (tag_name) @_tag
      (#lua-match? @_tag "^x%-%l")
    (attribute
      (attribute_name) @_attr
        (#lua-match? @_attr "^:%l")
      (quoted_attribute_value
        (attribute_value) @injection.content)
      (#set! injection.language "php_only"))))
```

## How to Highlight:

> ‚ùó Please note each **editor** uses it's own sets of
> predicates/variables so you need to look into their documentation.

This is what you need to use inside your `highlights.scm`. For ease
of use, I managed to boil everything down to the following
tree-sitter queries:

#### 1. (directives) `@theme_selector`

-   This is your keywords like `@csrf` or inline directives such as
    `@extends()`
-   By highlighting `(directive)` you are painting `@extends` in
    `@extends(x)` and the keywords

#### 2. (directive_start) `@theme_selector`

-   This is for multiline directives such as `@php x @endphp`
-   this will specifically target the `@php`

#### 3. (directive_end) `@theme_selector`

-   This is also for multiline directives such as `@php x @endphp`
-   However it will target the closing directive such as `@endphp`

#### 4. optional: (attribute (directive) `@theme_selector`)

-   You can use this to fine tune your highlight and grab the blade
    `attribute` directives to get highlighted as an `attribute`
-   This is optional, I understand some rather have blade highlighted
    as a framework tag

#### 5. (comment) `@theme_selector`

-   This is your comments `{{-- x --}}`
-   so you can add a capture for comment highlight to this query using
    `(comment)`

#### 6. optional: (bracket_start) `@theme_selector`

-   If you want to highlight your brackets such as `{{}}` use this to
    capture

#### 7. optional: (bracket_end) `@theme_selector`

-   If you want to highlight your brackets such as `{{}}` use this to
    capture

## Folding

> ‚ùó Please note each **editor** uses it's own sets of
> predicates/variables so you need to look into their documentation.

The grammar is written in a way to support code folding. You write
them in the `queries/folds.scm`.

As long as your editor supports `folds.scm` , you can easily write
predicates to implement foldings. This will allow you to clear up
clutter and focus on the feature you are working in hand.

You can have a look at `queries/folds.scm`, which has the excerpts
used to implement this feature in Nova.

The following is a list of `nodes` that you need to capture to
implement the folding

1. `(directive_start)` and `(directive_end)`
2. `(bracket_start)` and `(bracket_end)`

```scm
; Example Query used in Nova to implement folding

(   (directive_start) @start
    (directive_end) @end.after
    (#set! role block))


(   (bracket_start) @start
    (bracket_end) @end
    (#set! role block))
```

## Quick Note about `queries/` folder

This is for `tree-sitter cli`. Your editor or service might use a
different **_capture group_** name or **_predicates_**.

Consequently, you will need to find out how to approach queries or
where they are stored and used in your editor's documentation. For
example **_Nova_** does not use anything in this folder and uses its
own `Queries` folder instead.

## Issues

If something does not look right please raise an
[issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues) with a
detailed examples of what you are trying to achieve. Add any of the
following if necessary:

-   Code Excerpts (allows me to test)
-   Photo of the issue
-   Parse Tree (if inspectable by your editor)

If you need help with anything else or would like to share tips and
tricks for your fellow devs, feel free to use the
[discussion tab](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/discussions)
and create a discussion!
